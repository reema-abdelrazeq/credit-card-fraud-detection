# 🚨 Credit Card Fraud Detection 🚨
This project leverages deep learning to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets. The model is trained on imbalanced transaction data and utilizes a neural network architecture to classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. 🏦💳

# 🔍 Overview
The model is built using Keras with a Dense Neural Network architecture.
Class imbalance is handled effectively using class weights.
Performance is evaluated with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
